# CComp: A Parallel Compression Algorithm for Compressed Word Search
The goal of CComp is to achieve better compressed search times while achieving the same compression-decompression speed as other parallel compression algorithms. CComp achieves this by splitting both the word dictionaries and the input stream, processing them in parallel.

run script could be used to compile.
